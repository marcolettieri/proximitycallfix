I created this app because my Xiaomi has some bugs during the call and with my face I close the call or mute the microphone accidentally.

The application does nothing but lock the screen when the phone is brought close to the ear during a phone call.

Some special permissions are needed to lock the screen. If the application does not remain active in the background, disable battery optimizations on the app settings.

No ROOT required
